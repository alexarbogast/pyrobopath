This project contains python and ROS packages for working with robotic toolpaths. The target functionalities include:
* G-code interpretation and Python interfaces for working with G-code toolpaths in Python - including manipulation and visualization tools
* Collision checking with [python-fcl](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/python-fcl) and custom interfaces
* Scheduling tools for collision-free multi-agent robotic toolpaths

_This project is under heavy development and subject to changes in API and functionality._
