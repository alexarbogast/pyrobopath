PyRoboPath is a Python package for working with robotic toolpaths. The
target functionalities include:
* G-code interpretation and Python interfaces for working with G-code toolpaths
  in Python - including tools for path modification and visualization
* Path smoothing and trajectory parameterization
* Collision checking with
  [python-fcl](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/python-fcl) and custom
  interfaces
* A scheduling library providing interfaces for robotic toolpath scheduling
* Planning algorithms for scheduling multi-agent toolpaths
