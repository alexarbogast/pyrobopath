This project contains python and ROS packages for working with robotic
toolpaths. The target functionalities include:
* G-code interpretation and Python interfaces for working with G-code toolpaths
  in Python - including manipulation and visualization tools
* Collision checking with
  [python-fcl](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/python-fcl) and custom
  interfaces
* Scheduling tools for collision-free multi-agent robotic toolpaths

> [!NOTE]
