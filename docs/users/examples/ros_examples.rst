Pyrobopath offers an interface to `ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`_ through the
https://github.com/alexarbogast/pyrobopath_ros package. This package uses the
ROS framework to execute the motion of multi-agent schedules found with
Pyrobopath.

The documentation for this process is still in progress, but a good reference
is found in https://github.com/alexarbogast/hydra_tic_tac_toe.
